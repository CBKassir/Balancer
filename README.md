# Description

Overaching Idea: A physical system to realistically simulate any control system algorithm.

Here, this is a classic bearing balancer.
While every version I've seen uses 3 or 4 stepper motors, I thought, "Why not do it with 2?".
The challenge with using 2 is the slower robot speed between position transitions, making it a discrete control problem with low sampling rates.


# Currently

Fixing an electrical issue with the stepper driver power supply.

(Recently added some early progress photos. More photos incoming.)
